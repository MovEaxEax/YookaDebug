# YookaDebug
Modification for Yooka-Laylee which adds an DebugMode. Usefull for analyzing the game and practice.

# How to install
Go to your ../steam/steamapps/common/YookaLaylee/YookaLaylee64_Data/Managed directory and replace the Assembly-CSharp.dll with the modded one. Don't forget to make a Back-up of your original .dll, so you don't have to reload it if you wish to disable the DebugMode.

# How to use
- Open the DebugMenu with NUMPAD_0 or F10
- Click on the options you want to activate (Cursor get's enabled in this state)
- In the auto generated file ../steam/steamapps/common/YookaLaylee/xNyuDebug/key_settings.txt you can manually set the hotkeys and additional parameters. After edited this file, go back ingame and click the "Reload Hotkey Settings" option
